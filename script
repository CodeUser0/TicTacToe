# NOTES
# Game introduces tictactoe with brief description
# Game ask if player would like to play, then asks which symbol they would like to play as (X or O)
# game then asks player 1 where the would like to place their symbol, followed by player 2
# checks for tie, and wins and ends the game indicating which player is victorious
